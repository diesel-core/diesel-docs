# CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

## Basic Configuration

To enable CORS, you need to configure your server to allow requests from specific origins. Here's how to set it up...

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to set CORS headers in an Express.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();

// Enable CORS for all routes
app.use(cors());

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'This is CORS-enabled for all origins!' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
