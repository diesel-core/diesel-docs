title: Understanding Middleware
---


Middleware functions act as interceptors between incoming requests and outgoing responses. They’re powerful tools that enable:

## How Middleware Works

Middleware functions can:

- **Request validation**: Validate incoming data before proceeding to the route handler.
- **Authentication and authorization**: Check if users have the proper credentials.
- **Logging and debugging**: Track requests for analytics or debugging.
- **Error handling**: Capture errors early in the request-response cycle.

Middleware is generally applied to routes or groups of routes, and each piece of middleware in the chain can pass the request to the next handler, allowing layered processing.

## Example: JWT Authentication Middleware

Here’s a basic authentication middleware using JWT. Note that we don't need `next()` here. If a token is missing or invalid, the function returns early with a response; otherwise, it proceeds:

import {Code} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const exampleCode = `
async function authJwt(ctx: ContextType, server?: Server): Promise<void | Response> {
  try {
    const token = ctx.getCookie("accessToken");
    
    if (!token) {
      return ctx.json({ message: "Authentication token missing" },401);
    }
    
    // Verify the JWT token using a secret key
    const user = jwt.verify(token, secret);
    ctx.set('user', user);  // Store the user in the context
  } catch (error) {
    return ctx.json({ message: "Invalid token" },403);
  }
}
`;
export const fileName = `auth.ts`;
export const highlights = ['file', 'CMS'];

<Code code={exampleCode} lang='ts' title={fileName} mark={highlights}/>

**In this example**
* **No `next` nonsense** : Once conditions are met, the middleware proceeds ,there is no need to call  nonsense `next` function.
* **Immediate return** : If authentication fails, the request cycle stops, and an error response is sent to the client.

### Using Middleware
**You can apply middleware to the entire app or specific routes:**
```typescript
// Global middleware
app.use(authJwt);

// Route-specific middleware
app.use("/user", authJwt);
```
### Using Multiple Middleware Functions

**Diesel supports chaining multiple middleware functions in a single `app.use` call. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are provided:**

```typescript
// Applying multiple middleware globally
app.use([middleware1, middleware2, middleware3]);

// Applying multiple middleware to a specific path
app.use("/user", [middleware1, middleware2]);

app.use(["/user","/home"],[middleware1, middleware2])
```
### Route-specific Middleware in Handler Method

**In addition to `app.use`, you can attach middleware directly to individual routes. This allows for fine-tuned control, applying middleware only to specific requests.**

#### Example Usage
**Imagine you have an authentication middleware `authJwt`, which you only want to apply to specific routes. You can set it up like this:**

```typescript
// Define an endpoint with middleware
app.get("/user", authJwt, (ctx:ContextType) => {
  // Authenticated route logic
  return ctx.json({ message: "Welcome, authenticated user!" });
});

// You can add multiple middleware functions as needed
app.post("/post", authJwt, requestLogger, (ctx:ContextType) => {
  return ctx.json({ message: "Your post was successfully created!" });
});
```
**Here**:
* `authJwt` checks for user authentication.
* Additional middleware `(e.g., requestLogger)` can be added in the same line, providing flexibility.
* The main handler `(ctx) => {}` only runs if all middleware calls successfully proceed.



### Other Middleware Example

1. **Logging Middleware**
This logs request details:

```typescript
function requestLogger(ctx) {
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${ctx.req.method} ${ctx.req.url}`);
}
```
Apply it globally to log every request:
```typescript
app.use(requestLogger);
```
**Although you can use `onRequest()` hook to log incoming req details , 
which we will know in next section**  


# Summary
**Middleware in Diesel and other frameworks is powerful without `next()` handling:**
* **Early return**: If conditions aren’t met, simply return the response.
* **Proceeding**: By not returning, you continue to the next part of the middleware stack or route handler.

Middleware enhances your application’s functionality by allowing modular, reusable processing for requests and responses, ultimately creating a scalable, manageable application structure.
