title: Router Overview
---

In this document, we will cover the basic HTTP methods used in routing (GET, POST, etc.) and how to implement sub-routing in your application using the `app.register` method.

## HTTP Methods

#### Example:

```typescript

app.get('/home', (ctx:ContextType) => {
  ctx.status(200).text('Welcome to the home page!');
})

app.post("/upload",(ctx:ContextType) => {
    // your logic here
})

app.put("/update",(ctx:ContextType) => {
    // your logic here
})

app.patch("/patch",(ctx:ContextType) => {
    // your logic here
})

app.delete("/delete-user",(ctx:ContextType) => {
    // your logic here
})

```

## Sub-Routing with ***app.register***

**Sub-routing allows you to organize your routes better by grouping them based on functionality. In our example, we will register user-related routes under a versioned API.**

### Example

user.route.ts
```typescript
import {Router} from "diesel-core";

export const UserRoute = new Router();


route.get("/register/:id",(ctx:ContextType) => {
  return ctx.text('User registered with ID: ' + ctx.getParams('id'));
})

route.get("/login",(ctx:ContextType)=>{
  return ctx.text("hello loin")
})
```
**Registering Sub-Routes in the Main Application**

Now, in your main application, you can register these routes using the app.register method:
```typescript

import {UserRoute} from 'user.route.ts'

app.register("/api/v1/user",UserRoute)
```
***The `app.register()` Method***

**takes two arguments**
1. **path** : The base path where you want to group all your specific routes (e.g., /api/v1/user).
2. ** Router instance** : The router instance containing the routes you want to register (e.g., UserRoute).

This structure allows for better organization and modularization of your route definitions, leading to cleaner and more manageable code.

### Conclusion

**By understanding and utilizing HTTP methods along with sub-routing, you can create a well-structured and efficient routing system in your application. This approach not only enhances the clarity of your routes but also promotes better code organization.**
