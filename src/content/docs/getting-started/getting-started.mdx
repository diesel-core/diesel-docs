title: Getting Started with Diesel
---

Diesel is a simple and lightweight HTTP server library for Bun.js that provides you with complete control over your API routes and middleware. It is designed to be intuitive and efficient, allowing you to quickly set up a server, define routes, and optimize important paths for faster response times.

With built-in support for TypeScript, DieselJS ensures type safety and improved developer experience, making it easier to catch errors during development. Whether you are building a small application or a large API, DieselJS helps you manage your routes and middleware seamlessly.
## Quick Start

You can install Diesel from npm:


```bash
npm install diesel-core
```
```bash
bun add diesel-core
```
```bash
yarn add diesel-core
```
```bash
pnpm install diesel-core
```

### Code Example
```javascript
import {Diesel}  from "diesel-core"

const app = new Diesel()
const port = 3000

app.get("/", async (ctx:ContextType) => {
 return ctx.status(200).text("Hello world...!")
})

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`diesel is running on port ${port}`)
})
```
